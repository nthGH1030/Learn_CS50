Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
100 simulation caused Portugal as the second winner instead of Brazil

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

100000, theres no big difference between 100000 & 1000000 simulations
